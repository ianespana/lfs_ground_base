# Heracles' LFS Ground Vehicle Base
A Comprehensive vehicle base for building ground vehicles that utilize the power of LFS.
Please note this base does NOT contain any vehicles and is merely something that must be built upon!

# Download

**It is absolutely necessary that you have LFS version v158.GIT(GitHub) or v168.WS(Workshop) or newer. This addon will not work properly if you are running an outdated version!**

# About

### What is Heracles' LFS Ground Vehicle Base?

Heracles' LFS Ground Vehicle Base is a vehicle base that facilitates creating ground vehicles that utilize all the LFS functions. Vehicles made with this base will have teams assigned to them, they will be able to have multiple seats and multiple weapons.
The most common use for this base is for creating hover vehicles, such as Star Wars speeders, Halo tanks, amongst others.

This is the base which all LFS ground vehicles I create will use. This allows rapid deployment of changes that affect all vehicles, instead of having to update every single one to add new things.
Feel free to use this on your server!

# Getting Started
Using the ground base is quite easy. As long as you don't override any of it's components you just need to define your vehicle's seats and it's model.

The vehicle's movement characteristics can be easily tuned by simply moving a couple of variables.

More complex behaviour can be achieved by hooking or overriding certain functions, more info and examples can be found [on the wiki](https://ianespana.github.io/lfs_ground_base/)
